VIsion VIDeo Library - ViVid
=============================

ViVid is a collection of GPU optimized routines that emphasizes data parallelism in common vision algorithms.  The underlying GPU code is coded in CUDA and assumes CUDA compute capability >= 2.1 .  The scripting layer is Python.  This enables seamless integration with other libraries that offer Python bindings, in particular OpenCV.
